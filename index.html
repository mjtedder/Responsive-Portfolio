        Hajimemashite! Nice to meet you. My name is Matt Tedder, and I assume you are reading this to get some insight into who I am.
        I'm just like you, drifting through life trying to figure everything out.
        While experiencing this thing called life, I was presented the opportunity to live in Japan for a few years. This was a blessing that took everything I thought I knew about life and turned it upside down.
        I am so grateful for this because it allowed me to be a more understanding, open-minded, and empathetic person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now thirty years old, I am ready to stop pretending I enjoy where I work and pursue something I have always been fascinated with since a young age: technology!
        Hurling into existence in 1987, I am in a unique space to know what it was like before we were hit by the Internet, yet still young enough to fully embrace/appreciate it.
        Even today I still have to stop and marvel at what we humans have been able to create with our brains. Well, I guess that is all on me for now, thanks for reading!
      </p>
